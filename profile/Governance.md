# Governance of **pypomp**

**pypomp** is a collaborative organization, directed by its core development team. Core developers are as follows:

| Name          | GitHub id  |Start date | End date | Comments        |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------- | -------- | --------------- |
| Kevin Tan     | hetankevin | 8/27/24   |          | founding member |
| Ed Ionides    | ionides    | 8/27/24   |          | founding member |
| Jesse Wheeler | jeswheel   | 8/27/24   |          | founding member |
| Jun Chen      | junch2002  | 8/27/24   |          | founding member | 

The current maintainer is Ed Ionides.

We have a few rules, sufficient for a small and friendly organization.

## Rules

1. Decisions are made by a majority vote of the core developers. The result of a tied vote is determined by the maintainer. Votes will usually be held by email. Any core developer can call a vote. A 2/3 quorum of the core developers is required to obtain a decision. Votes of "abstain" count toward quorum but are excluded for determining whether the vote has majority support.

2. The core development team votes to select a maintainer who is responsible for keeping an up-to-date version of Python packages on PyPI.

3. All core developers can edit the source code without requiring approval from other core developers.  All core developers can incorporate edits proposed by other contributors. No developer should change the edit history, and therefore any change can be reversed if the core development team decides to do so.

4. New core developers are selected by a vote of the existing core developers.

5. Anyone who writes code included in pypomp is a contributor. A core developer can also add someone to a list of contributors if they have contributed to the project in some other way such as writing open-source applications using pypomp.
